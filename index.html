            <h3>Database Management System</h3>
          </div>
          <p>
            A database management system (DBMS) is the software that interacts
            with end users, applications, and the database itself to capture
            and analyze the data. The DBMS software additionally encompasses
            the core facilities provided to administer the database. The sum
            total of the database, the DBMS and the associated applications
            can be referred to as a database system. Often the term "database"
            is also used loosely to refer to any of the DBMS, the database
            system or an application associated with the database.
          </p>
          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>
            The sizes, capabilities, and performance of databases and their
            respective DBMSs have grown in orders of magnitude. These
            performance increases were enabled by the technology progress in
            the areas of processors, computer memory, computer storage, and
            computer networks. The concept of a database was made possible by
            the emergence of direct access storage media such as magnetic
            disks, which became widely available in the mid 1960s; earlier
            systems relied on sequential storage of data on magnetic tape. The
            subsequent development of database technology can be divided into
            three eras based on data model or structure: navigational,[8]
            SQL/relational, and post-relational.
          </p>
          <h2>Navigational DBMS</h2>
          <p>
            <img src="assets/images/Charles.png" alt="Charles Bachman pic" class="profile-pic float-right" />
            The introduction of the term database coincided with the
            availability of direct-access storage (disks and drums) from the
            mid-1960s onwards. Navigational DBMS was proposed by
            <strong>Charles Bachman</strong>. In 1971, the Database Task Group
            delivered their standard, which generally became known as the
            CODASYL approach, and soon a number of commercial products based
            on this approach entered the market.The CODASYL approach offered
            applications the ability to navigate around a linked data set
            which was formed into a large network. Applications could find
            records by one of three methods:
          </p>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>
              Use of a primary key (known as a CALC key, typically implemented
              by hashing)
            </li>
            <li>
              Navigating relationships (called sets) from one record to
              another
            </li>
            <li>Scanning all the records in a sequential order</li>
          </ol>
          <h2>Relational DBMS</h2>
          <p>
            <img src="assets/images/edgar.png" alt="Edgar F. Codd pic" class="profile-pic float-left" />
            Edgar F. Codd worked at IBM in San Jose, California, in one of
            their offshoot offices that was primarily involved in the
            development of hard disk systems. He was unhappy with the
            navigational model of the CODASYL approach, notably the lack of a
            "search" facility. In 1970, he wrote a number of papers that
            outlined a new approach to database construction that eventually
            culminated in the groundbreaking A Relational Model of Data for
            Large Shared Data Banks.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this paper, he described a new system for storing and working
            with large databases. Instead of records being stored in some sort
            of linked list of free-form records as in CODASYL, Codd's idea was
            to organize the data as a number of "tables", each table being
            used for a different type of entity. Each table would contain a
            fixed number of columns containing the attributes of the entity.
            One or more columns of each table were designated as a primary key
            by which the rows of the table could be uniquely identified;
            cross-references between tables always used these primary keys,
            rather than disk addresses, and queries would join tables based on
            these key relationships, using a set of operations based on the
            mathematical system of relational calculus (from which the model
            takes its name). Splitting the data into a set of normalized
            tables (or relations) aimed to ensure that each "fact" was only
            stored once, thus simplifying update operations. Virtual tables
            called views could present the data in different ways for
            different users, but views could not be directly updated.
          </p>
          <h2>SQL DBMS</h2>
          <p>
            IBM started working on a prototype system loosely based on Codd's
            concepts as System R in the early 1970s. The first version was
            ready in 1974/5, and work then started on multi-table systems in
            which the data could be split so that all of the data for a record
            (some of which is optional) did not have to be stored in a single
            large "chunk". Subsequent multi-user versions were tested by
            customers in 1978 and 1979, by which time a standardized query
            language SQL had been added. Codd's ideas were establishing
            themselves as both workable and superior to CODASYL, pushing IBM
            to develop a true production version of System R, known as SQL/DS,
            and, later, Database 2
          </p>
          <h2>NoSQL and NewSQL</h2>
          <p>
            XML databases are a type of structured document-oriented database
            that allows querying based on XML document attributes. XML
            databases are mostly used in applications where the data is
            conveniently viewed as a collection of documents, with a structure
            that can vary from the very flexible to the highly rigid: examples
            include scientific articles, patents, tax filings, and personnel
            records.
          </p>
          <p>
            NoSQL databases are often very fast, do not require fixed table
            schemas, avoid join operations by storing denormalized data, and
            are designed to scale horizontally.
          </p>
          <p>
            NewSQL is a class of modern relational databases that aims to
            provide the same scalable performance of NoSQL systems for online
            transaction processing (read-write) workloads while still using
            SQL and maintaining the ACID guarantees of a traditional database
            system.

            <h3>Structured Query Language</h3>
          </div>
          <p>
            SQL is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed
            for managing data held in a relational database management system
            (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream
            management system (RDSMS). It is particularly useful in handling
            structured data, i.e. data incorporating relations among entities
            and variables. SQL offers two main advantages over older
            read-write APIs such as ISAM or VSAM. Firstly, it introduced the
            concept of accessing many records with one single command.
            Secondly, it eliminates the need to specify how to reach a record,
            e.g. with or without an index.
          </p>
          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>
            <img src="assets/images/donald.png" alt="Donald D.Chamberlin pic" class="profile-pic float-right" />
            SQL was initially developed at IBM by Donald D. Chamberlin and
            Raymond F. Boyce after learning about the relational model from
            Edgar F. Codd in the early 1970s. This version, initially called
            SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language), was designed to
            manipulate and retrieve data stored in IBM's original
            quasirelational database management system, System R, which a
            group at IBM San Jose Research Laboratory had developed during the
            1970s. After testing SQL at customer test sites to determine the
            usefulness and practicality of the system, IBM began developing
            commercial products based on their System R prototype, including
            System/38, SQL/DS, and DB2, which were commercially available in
            1979, 1981, and 1983, respectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the late 1970s, Relational Software, Inc. (now Oracle
            Corporation) saw the potential of the concepts described by Codd,
            Chamberlin, and Boyce, and developed their own SQL-based RDBMS
            with aspirations of selling it to the U.S. Navy, Central
            Intelligence Agency, and other U.S. government agencies. In June
            1979, Relational Software introduced one of the first commercially
            available implementations of SQL, Oracle V2 (Version2) for VAX
            computers

            <h2>Hi I'm Vineeth</h2>
            <p>I'm an UnderGraduate student in IIITDM Kanceepuram having my major in computerscience. I have completed
              my schooling in my hometown and completed pre-graduation in Kurnool. I have a deep passion in
              CyberSecurity sector. I love to explore new things.</p>
            <p>
              I have started my research on WebDev from Feb 2022. Doing WebDev intrests me alot. I am also planning to
              learn flutter and build apps. Working on flutter was very nice. Developing an app has been a intrest in me
              from many years. I am so happy that one of my dream is going to come true.
            </p>
            <p>
              Apart from studies i love to write stories. Stories I write are mostly doesnt contain any dialogue part. I
              am planning to do some shortfilms with my friends. I started this story writing habit when im in 10th
              class but it took a serious turn in this lockdown. i listen to music alot. Most people say listening music
              might give a feel like staying in another world I am one of those most people.
